### About me

I am a research consultant at Michigan State University's Institute for Cyber-Enabled Research.

I am most often found helping other researchers improve their scientific software or learn how
to use high-performance computing resources.

My research is focused on astrophysics, primarily Type Ia supernovae and massive stars. 

I am a contributor to the TARDIS radiative transfer code and related projects at https://github.com/tardis-sn/

You may also find some of my hobby projects on this page.
